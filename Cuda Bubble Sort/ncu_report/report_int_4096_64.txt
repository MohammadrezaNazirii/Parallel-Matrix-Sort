          The difference between calculated theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (4.2%) can be the      
          result of warp scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can   
          occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices   
          Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#occupancy) for more details on     
          optimizing occupancy.
