    OPT   This kernel grid is too small to fill the available resources on this device, resulting in only 0.0 full

          The grid for this launch is configured to execute only 16 blocks, which is less than the GPU's 24             
          multiprocessors. This can underutilize some multiprocessors. If you do not intend to execute this kernel      
          concurrently with other workloads, consider reducing the block size to have at least one block per            
          multiprocessor or increase the size of the grid to fully utilize the available hardware resources. See the

          The difference between calculated theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (4.2%) can be the      
          result of warp scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can   
          occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices   
          Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#occupancy) for more details on
